// What must Store do?
// The store command writes the current records, in the 
// dynamic doubly linked list, to the musicPlayList.csv file. 
// The store will completely overwrite the previous contents in the file.


// What must Display do?
// The display command prints record to the screen. 
// This command MUST support two methods, 
// one of which is selected by the user:
// Print all records.
// Print all records that match an artist.


// What must Edit do?
// The edit command MUST allow the user to find a record in the list 
// by the artist. If there are multiple records with the same artist, 
// then your program must prompt the user which one to edit. 
// The user may modify all of the attributes in the record.


// What must Rate do?
// The rate command MUST allow the user to assign a value of 
// 1 to 5 to a song; 1 is the lowest rating and 5 is the highest rating. 
// The rating will replace the previous rating.


// What must Play do?
// The play command MUST allow the user to select a song and must start playing 
// each song in order from the current song. 
// Playing the song for this assignment means displaying the 
// contents of the record that represents the song for a short period of time, 
// clearing the screen and showing the next record in the list, etc. 
// This continues until all songs have been played.


// What must Delete do?
// The delete command MUST prompt the user for a song title, 
// and remove the matching record from the list. If the song title does not exist, then the list remains unchanged.


// What must Insert do?
// The insert command MUST prompt the user for the details of 
// a new record. The prompt must request the artist name, album title, song title, genre, song length, number of times played, 
// and rating. Then prompt the user where to insert the record, front or back of the list. Add the new record based on the user response.


// What must Shuffle do?
// The shuffle command MUST provide a random order in which the songs are played. This command MUST not modify the links in the list. 
// It must just specify the order in which songs are played, based on the position of the song in the list. For example,
// letâ€™s say we have a list with 5 songs at positions 1 - 5 in the list, 
// shuffle must generate an order 1 -5 in which the songs are played. 
// An order 2, 5, 3, 1, 4 would require that the second song in the list is played first, 
// the fifth song in the list is played second, the third song in the list is played third, the first song in the list is played fourth, 
// and the fourth song in the list is played fifth. 
// The songs are accessed by traversing the list both forwards and backward to satisfy the order. Hence, the need for a doubly-linked list.


// What must Sort do? (EXTRA CREDIT: 25 points)
// The sort command MUST prompt the user for 4 different methods to sort the records in the list. These include:
// Sort based on artist (A-Z)
// Sort based on album title (A-Z)
// Sort based on rating (1-5)
// Sort based on times played (largest-smallest)


// Once a sort method is selected by the user, 
// the sort must be performed on the records in the list. 
// Use whatever sorting algorithm you want to use: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort or quicksort.


// What must Exit do?
// The exit command saves the most recent list to the musicPlayLIst.csv file. 
// This command will completely overwrite the previous contents in the file.
