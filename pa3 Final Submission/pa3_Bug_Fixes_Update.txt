*********DEBUGGING/PATCH NOTES*************
THIS DEBUG WAS DONE WHILE IMPLEMENTING THE WHILE LOOP INTO OUR REVGENE PORTION OF MAIN-5.CPP

1)-LINES  53 & 120: Removed +2 from the stop condon assignment to stop and stop2. 
	This was causing the vector to move 2 elements past the last element resulting 
	in an out of bounds state which in turn resulted in the gene's position and size 
	being incorrectly displayed.

2)-Moved startCondon.clear() and stopCondon.clear() to lines 101 and 102. 
	This was to prevent the data from being cleared multiple times.

3)-Added revGene as a function call to allow the program to "reverse" the genome first
	 before being assigned to the variable spinMeRightRound. This allowed 
	for the correct sorting of output on line 117 after the findCondon calls on lines 112 - 115.

4)-Swapped startIndex and stopIndex to line 138 with geneLength to line 139 to match instructors
	desired output for formatting.

5)- LINES 96 & 164: Added (fileName + "_rev_genes.fna ") and (fileName + "_genes.fna ") 
	to take the entered file name by the reasearcher for univeral consistancy to 
	the original file name in the creation of the new report files from our program.

6)- Lines 70 & 137: Changed the output function from i + 1 to numPotentialGenes + 1.
	using i has the potential to skip a possible gene when a start condon is detected
	but no end condon is found. Thus reporting in our initial report Gene # 101 was skipped
	resulting in the output to the file being 99, 100, 102. This fix allows numPotential genes
	and numRevGenes to accurately relate the found genes from the loop and not account for any
	skipped results.
